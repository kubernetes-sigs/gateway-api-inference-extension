# Conformance Reports for Gateway API Inference Extension

This directory stores conformance reports submitted by various implementations of the Gateway API Inference Extension. This structure closely follows the [kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/conformance/reports](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/conformance/reports/README).

## How this folder is structured

This folder stores conformance reports organized by the version of the Gateway API Inference Extension specification they were tested against:

|-- conformance/reports
|   |-- v0.3.0  # Example version
|   |   |-- my-inference-gateway
|   |   |   |-- README.md
|   |   |   |-- experimental-v1.2.3-default-report.yaml # Example report file
|   |   |-- another-implementation
|   |   |   |-- README.md
|   |   |   |-- ...
|   |-- v0.4.0 # Future version
|   |   |-- ...

## Implementation Submissions

Each implementation conformant with a specific version of the Gateway API Inference Extension should have its own folder within the corresponding version directory (e.g., `/conformance/reports/v0.3.0/my-implementation/`).

The implementation is the owner of its folder and is responsible for:

1.  Uploading one or more conformance reports (YAML files).
2.  Maintaining a mandatory `README.md` file within their folder, structured as follows:

    # My Inference Gateway Implementation

    General information about the My/Implementation project.

    ## Table of Contents

    | Extension Channel | Extension Version Tested | Implementation Version | Mode    | Report                                            |
    |-------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------|
    | experimental      | v0.3.0                   | v1.2.3                 | default | [v1.2.3 report](./experimental-v1.2.3-default-report.yaml) |
    | ...               | ...                      | ...                    | ...     | ...                                               |

    ## Reproduce

    Instructions on how to reproduce the claimed report(s).

### Table of Contents (within Implementation README)

The table of contents within an implementation's `README.md` should contain one row for each submitted report and include the following columns:

* **Extension Channel**: The channel of the Gateway API Inference Extension (e.g., `standard` or `experimental`). Must correspond to the `gatewayAPIInferenceExtensionChannel` field in the report.
* **Extension Version Tested**: The version of the Gateway API Inference Extension specification tested against (e.g., `v0.3.0`). Must correspond to the `gatewayAPIInferenceExtensionVersion` field in the report.
* **Implementation Version**: A link to the GitHub/website page for the specific release/commit of the implementation tested. The version value MUST correspond to the `implementation.version` field in the report.
* **Mode**: The operating mode of the implementation used for the test run (default is `default`). Must correspond to the `mode` field in the report. If a mode other than `default` is used, the "Reproduce" section must explain how to configure it.
* **Report**: A link to the corresponding report YAML file. Reports MUST be named according to the pattern: `<Extension Channel>-<Implementation Version>-<Mode>-report.yaml`.

### Reproduce Section (within Implementation README)

This section MUST exist and contain the manual or automatic steps required to reproduce the results claimed by the uploaded conformance reports for that specific implementation. If reproduction steps differ significantly between implementation versions, use sub-sections.

## Report Files

Conformance reports MUST be uploaded exactly as generated by the official Gateway API Inference Extension conformance test suite, without any modifications. The "Reproduce" section allows for verification of the submitted report against a fresh run.

### Report Rules

To be accepted, submitted conformance reports must comply with the following rules:

1.  **Implementation Details:** All fields within the `implementation` block must have meaningful values:
    * `organization`: The entity maintaining the implementation (company, open source org, individual).
    * `project`: The name of the implementation project, unique within the organization.
    * `url`: A valid URL for the project (e.g., GitHub repository, product page).
    * `version`: A specific, reproducible snapshot of the implementation (e.g., tag, commit hash, release version). Branch names are not acceptable.
    * `contact`: A list of contact points (GitHub handles like `@maintainer`, team handles like `@org/team`, email addresses, or support URLs like an issue tracker).
2.  **Inference Extension Versioning:** The report MUST include:
    * `gatewayAPIInferenceExtensionVersion`: The specific version of the Gateway API Inference Extension specification tested against (e.g., `v0.3.0`).
    * `gatewayAPIInferenceExtensionChannel`: The channel (`standard` or `experimental`) corresponding to the tested version.
3.  **Mode:** The `mode` field indicates the implementation's operating mode during the test run.
4.  **Test Profile & Result:**
    * The report MUST contain exactly one profile result under the `profiles` list.
    * This profile MUST have `name: InferenceGateway`.
    * The profile's `result` field MUST be `success`. A `success` result indicates that **all** tests defined within the Gateway API Inference Extension conformance suite for the specified version passed. (Note: Unlike core Gateway API, there are currently no optional "extended" features within the Inference Extension conformance profile itself; all included tests are considered mandatory for conformance).

## Submission Process

Conformance reports demonstrating a `success` result for the `InferenceGateway` profile should be submitted via Pull Request directly to this repository (`kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api-inference-extension`).

1.  Create a new folder under `/conformance/reports/<extension-version>/` named after your implementation (e.g., `/conformance/reports/v0.3.0/my-implementation/`).
2.  Add your implementation's `README.md` to this folder, following the structure described above.
3.  Add your generated conformance report YAML file(s) to this folder, ensuring they follow the naming convention `<Extension Channel>-<Implementation Version>-<Mode>-report.yaml`.
4.  Submit the Pull Request.
