              and rollout of new versions of those models, and defines the specific
              performance and latency goals for the model. These workloads are
              expected to operate within an InferencePool sharing compute capacity with other
              InferenceObjectives, defined by the Inference Platform Admin.

                description: |-
                  Priority defines how important it is to serve the request compared to other requests in the same pool.
                  Priority is an integer value that defines the priority of the request.
                  The higher the value, the more critical the request is; negative values _are_ allowed.
                  No default value is set for this field, allowing for future additions of new fields that may 'one of' with this field.
                  However, implementations that consume this field (such as the Endpoint Picker) will treat an unset value as '0'.
                  Priority is used in flow control, primarily in the event of resource scarcity(requests need to be queued).
                  All requests will be queued, and flow control will _always_ allow requests of higher priority to be served first.
                  Fairness is only enforced and tracked between requests of the same priority.

                  Example: requests with Priority 10 will always be served before
                  requests with Priority of 0 (the value used if Priority is unset or no InfereneceObjective is specified).
                  Similarly requests with a Priority of -10 will always be served after requests with Priority of 0.
