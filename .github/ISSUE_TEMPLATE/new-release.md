## Release Checklist
- [ ] For major or minor releases (v$MAJ.$MIN.0), create a new release branch.
  - [ ] A maintainer creates a vanilla release branch with
        `git branch release-$MAJ.$MIN main`
  - [ ] A maintainer pushes the new release branch with
        `git push release-$MAJ.$MIN` (e.g., release-0.1)
- [ ] Update content and artifacts such as README, deployment templates, docs, configuration, test/e2e flags.
      Submit a PR against the release branch.
- [ ] A maintainer [prepares a draft release](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api-inference-extension/releases)
  - [ ] Write the change log into the draft release.
  - [ ] Run
      `make artifacts`
      to generate the artifacts and upload the files in the `artifacts` folder to the draft release.
- [ ] A maintainer creates a signed tag running (e.g., VERSION=v0.1.0)
     `git tag -s $VERSION`
      and inserts the changelog into the tag description.
      To perform this step, you need [a PGP key registered on github](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/checking-for-existing-gpg-keys).
