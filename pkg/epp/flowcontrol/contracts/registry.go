// FlowRegistry is the complete interface for the global flow control plane.
// It composes the client-facing data path interface and the administrative interface. A concrete implementation of this
// interface is the single source of truth for all flow control state.
//
// # Conformance: Implementations MUST be goroutine-safe.
//
// # Flow Lifecycle
//
// A flow instance, identified by its immutable `types.FlowKey`, has a lease-based lifecycle managed by this interface.
// Any implementation MUST adhere to this lifecycle:
//
//  1. Lease Acquisition: A client calls Connect to acquire a lease. This signals that the flow is in use and protects
//     it from garbage collection. If the flow does not exist, it is created Just-In-Time (JIT).
//  2. Active State: A flow is "Active" as long as its lease count is greater than zero.
//  3. Lease Release: The client MUST call `Close()` on the returned `FlowConnection` to release the lease.
//     When the lease count drops to zero, the flow becomes "Idle".
//  4. Garbage Collection: The implementation MUST automatically garbage collect a flow after it has remained
//     continuously Idle for a configurable duration.
//
// # System Invariants
//
// Concrete implementations MUST uphold the following invariants:
//
//  1. Shard Consistency: All configured priority bands and registered flow instances must exist on every Active shard.
//  2. Capacity Partitioning: Global and per-band capacity limits must be uniformly partitioned across all Active
//     shards.

	// 2. Lease Acquisition: It acquires a lifecycle lease, protecting the flow from garbage collection.
	// 3. Callback Execution: It invokes the provided function `fn`, passing in a temporary `ActiveFlowConnection` handle.
	// 4. Guaranteed Lease Release: It ensures the lease is safely released when the callback function returns.
	//
	// This functional, callback-based approach makes resource leaks impossible, as the caller is not responsible for
