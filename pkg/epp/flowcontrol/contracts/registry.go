// FlowRegistry is the complete interface for the global control plane. An implementation of this interface is the single
// source of truth for all flow control state and configuration.
//
// # Conformance
//
// All methods MUST be goroutine-safe. Implementations are expected to perform complex updates (e.g.,
// `RegisterOrUpdateFlow`) atomically.
//
// # System Invariants
//
// Concrete implementations MUST uphold the following invariants:
//  1. Shard Consistency: All configured priority bands and registered flow instances must exist on every Active shard.
//     Plugin instance types must be consistent for a given flow across all shards.
//  2. Flow Instance Uniqueness: Each unique `types.FlowKey` (`ID` + `Priority`) corresponds to exactly one managed flow
//     instance.
//  3. Capacity Partitioning: Global and per-band capacity limits must be uniformly partitioned across all Active
//     shards.
//
// # Flow Lifecycle
//
// A flow instance (identified by its immutable `FlowKey`) has a simple lifecycle:
//
//   - Registered: Known to the `FlowRegistry` via `RegisterOrUpdateFlow`.
//   - Idle: Queues are empty across all Active and Draining shards.
//   - Garbage Collected (Unregistered): The registry automatically garbage collects flows after they have remained Idle
//     for a configurable duration.
//
// # Shard Lifecycle
//
// When a shard is decommissioned, it is marked inactive (`IsActive() == false`) to prevent new enqueues. The shard
// continues to drain and is deleted only after it is empty.
type FlowRegistry interface {
	FlowRegistryAdmin
	ShardProvider
}

// FlowRegistryAdmin defines the administrative interface for the global control plane.
//
// # Dynamic Update Strategies
//
// The contract specifies behaviors for handling dynamic updates, prioritizing stability and correctness:
//
//   - Immutable Flow Identity (`types.FlowKey`): The system treats the `FlowKey` (`ID` + `Priority`) as the immutable
//     identifier. Changing the priority of traffic requires registering a new `FlowKey`. The old flow instance is
//     automatically garbage collected when Idle. This design eliminates complex priority migration logic.
//
//   - Graceful Draining (Shard Scale-Down): Decommissioned shards enter a Draining state. They stop accepting new
//     requests but continue to be processed for dispatch until empty.
//
//   - Self-Balancing (Shard Scale-Up): When new shards are added, the `controller.FlowController`'s distribution logic
//     naturally utilizes them, funneling new requests to the less-loaded shards. Existing queued items are not
//     migrated.
type FlowRegistryAdmin interface {
	// RegisterOrUpdateFlow handles the registration of a new flow instance or the update of an existing instance's
	// specification (for the same `types.FlowKey`). The operation is atomic across all shards.
	//
	// Since the `FlowKey` (including `Priority`) is immutable, this method cannot change a flow's priority.
	// To change priority, the caller should simply register the new `FlowKey`; the old flow instance will be
	// automatically garbage collected when it becomes Idle.

	// fails.
