// ItemComparator encapsulates the logic for comparing two `types.QueueItemAccessor` instances to determine their
// relative dispatch priority. It is the definitive source of ordering truth for a flow's queue.
//
// It is vended by an `IntraFlowDispatchPolicy` to make its internal ordering logic explicit and available to other
// components. It is used by `SafeQueue` implementations that support the `CapabilityPriorityConfigurable` capability
// and can also be used by inter-flow policies to compare items from different queues.
//
// Design Justification: This design treats item priority as a relational concept defined by a policy, rather than a
// static attribute on the item itself. This allows for sophisticated, dynamic priority evaluation (e.g., based on
// real-time SLO attainment), as the comparison logic can be stateful.
type ItemComparator interface {
	// Func returns the core comparison logic as an `ItemComparatorFunc`.
	//
	// This function is the single source of truth for determining the relative priority between two items. A `SafeQueue`

	// policies MAY use this function to compare items from different queues, but only after verifying that their
	// `ScoreType()` values are identical, ensuring the comparison is meaningful.

	// ScoreType returns a string descriptor that defines the semantic meaning and domain of the comparison logic.
	//
	// A non-empty, descriptive string is required for two primary reasons:
	//  1. Comparability Check: Inter-flow policies that compare items across different queues (e.g., a "BestHead" policy)
	//     MUST check for identical `ScoreType` strings before using the comparator functions. A comparison is only
	//     meaningful if the underlying scoring logic is the same.
	//  2. Introspectability: The string makes the priority scheme human-readable for debugging and observability.
	//
	// Examples: "enqueue_time_ns_asc", "slo_urgency_score_desc".
	//
	// Future Considerations: While currently a simple string for initial simplicity, a future enhancement could introduce
	// a more structured `ScoreType`. Such a structure might explicitly encode ordering (ascending/descending) and value
	// semantics (e.g., time, custom_metric), potentially enabling advanced features like cross-`ScoreType` normalization
	// plugins.
	//
	// Conformance:
	//   - MUST return a non-empty, meaningful string that describes the domain or unit of comparison.
	//   - For the present, policies MUST NOT assume any implicit cross-`ScoreType` normalization capabilities.
