// FlowKey is the unique, immutable identifier for a single, independently managed flow instance within the
// `contracts.FlowRegistry`.
// It combines a logical grouping `ID` with a specific `Priority` level to form a composite primary key.
//
// The core architectural principle of this model is that each unique, immutable `FlowKey` represents a completely
// separate stream of traffic with its own queue, lifecycle and statistics.
type FlowKey struct {
	// ID is the logical grouping identifier for a flow, such as a tenant ID or a model name. This ID can be shared across
	// multiple `FlowKey`s to represent different classes of traffic for the same logical entity. It provides a way to
	// group related traffic but does not uniquely identify a manageable flow instance on its own.
	ID string

	// Priority is the numerical priority level that defines the priority band for this specific flow instance.
	//
	// A different Priority value for the same ID creates a distinct flow instance. For example, the keys
	// `{ID: "TenantA", Priority: 10}` and `{ID: "TenantA", Priority: 100}` are treated as two completely separate,
	// concurrently active flows. This allows a single tenant to serve traffic at multiple priority levels simultaneously.
	//
	// Because the `FlowKey` is immutable, changing the priority of traffic requires using a new `FlowKey`; the old flow
	// instance will be automatically garbage collected by the registry when it becomes idle.

// Compare provides a stable comparison function for two FlowKey instances, suitable for use with sorting algorithms.
// It returns -1 if the key is less than the other, 0 if they are equal, and 1 if the key is greater than the other.
// The comparison is performed first by Priority (descending) and then by ID (ascending).

// can be updated via `RegisterOrUpdateFlow` to modify configurable parameters (e.g., policies, capacity limits) for the
// existing flow instance (when these update stories are supported).
