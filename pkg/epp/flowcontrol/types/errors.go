var (
	// ErrRejected is a sentinel error indicating a request was rejected by the `controller.FlowController` *before* being
	// formally enqueued. Errors returned by `FlowController.EnqueueAndWait()` that signify pre-queue rejection will wrap
	// this error.
	//
	// Callers should use `errors.Is(err, ErrRejected)` to check for this general class of failure.
	ErrRejected = errors.New("request rejected pre-queue")

	// ErrEvicted is a sentinel error indicating a request was removed from a queue *after* being successfully enqueued,
	// but for reasons other than successful dispatch (e.g., TTL expiry, displacement). Errors returned by
	// `FlowController.EnqueueAndWait()` that signify post-queue eviction will wrap this error.
	//
	// Callers should use `errors.Is(err, ErrEvicted)` to check for this general class of failure.
	ErrEvicted = errors.New("request evicted from queue")

// --- Pre-Enqueue Rejection Errors ---

// The following errors can occur before a request is formally added to a `framework.SafeQueue`. When returned by
// `FlowController.EnqueueAndWait()`, these specific errors will typically be wrapped by `ErrRejected`.

	// ErrNilRequest indicates that a nil `types.FlowControlRequest` was provided.

	// ErrQueueAtCapacity indicates that a request could not be enqueued because queue capacity limits were met.
	ErrQueueAtCapacity = errors.New("queue at capacity and displacement failed to make space")
)

// --- Post-Enqueue Eviction Errors ---

// The following errors occur when a request, already in a `framework.SafeQueue`, is removed for reasons other than
// dispatch. When returned by `FlowController.EnqueueAndWait()`, these specific errors will typically be wrapped by
// `ErrEvicted`.
var (
	// ErrTTLExpired indicates a request was evicted from a queue because its effective Time-To-Live expired.
	ErrTTLExpired = errors.New("request TTL expired")

	// ErrContextCancelled indicates a request was evicted because its associated context (from
	// `FlowControlRequest.Context()`) was cancelled. This error typically wraps the underlying `context.Canceled` or
	// `context.DeadlineExceeded` error.
	ErrContextCancelled = errors.New("request context cancelled")
)

// --- General `controller.FlowController` Errors ---

var (
	// ErrFlowControllerShutdown indicates that an operation could not complete or an item was evicted because the
	// `controller.FlowController` is shutting down or has stopped.
	//
	// When returned by `FlowController.EnqueueAndWait()`, this will be wrapped by `ErrRejected` (if rejection happens
	// before internal queuing) or `ErrEvicted` (if eviction happens after internal queuing).
	ErrFlowControllerShutdown = errors.New("FlowController is shutting down")
