// Package registry provides the concrete implementation of the Flow Registry.
//
// As the stateful control plane for the entire Flow Control system, this package is responsible for managing the
// lifecycle of all flows, queues, and policies. It serves as the "adapter" that implements the service "ports"
// (interfaces) defined in the `contracts` package. It provides a sharded, concurrent-safe view of its state to the
// `controller.FlowController` workers, enabling scalable, parallel request processing.
//
// # Key Components
//
//   - `FlowRegistry`: The future top-level administrative object that will manage the entire system, including shard
//     lifecycles and flow registration. (Not yet implemented).
//
//   - `registryShard`: A concrete implementation of the `contracts.RegistryShard` interface. It represents a single,
//     concurrent-safe slice of the registry's state, containing a set of priority bands and the flow queues within
//     them. This is the primary object a `controller.FlowController` worker interacts with.
//
//   - `managedQueue`: A concrete implementation of the `contracts.ManagedQueue` interface. It acts as a stateful
//     decorator around a `framework.SafeQueue`, adding critical registry-level functionality such as atomic statistics
//     tracking and lifecycle state enforcement (active vs. draining).
//
//   - `Config`: The top-level configuration object that defines the structure and default behaviors of the registry,
//     including the definition of priority bands and default policy selections. This configuration is partitioned and
//     distributed to each `registryShard`.
